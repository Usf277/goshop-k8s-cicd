# üöÄ GoShop: Dockerized & Deployable E-commerce Platform

> üõí Forked and customized from [ke444a/ecommerce-goshop](https://github.com/ke444a/ecommerce-goshop) ‚Äî full credit to the original author. This project is licensed under the MIT license.

GoShop is a full-stack e-commerce web application originally built with:

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript (Vite), Redux Toolkit, TailwindCSS, Firebase Auth, React Router, React Query  
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Prisma ORM, Stripe, MySQL, Cloudinary

The application supports:

- Full product browsing, cart, and checkout  
- Admin management of products and orders  
- Firebase authentication with Google login  
- Stripe payments  
- PWA support and Cypress testing

## üõ†Ô∏è What I‚Äôve Done in This Fork

This fork transforms GoShop into a **DevOps-ready, containerized application** suitable for local development, testing, and automated deployment via Kubernetes and GitHub Actions.

### ‚úÖ Modifications & Additions

- **Dockerization:**
  - Created a production-ready Dockerfile for the frontend (React + Vite + Nginx)
  - Used the original backend‚Äôs multistage Dockerfile for Node.js/Prisma

- **Docker Compose Setup:**
  - Added `docker-compose.yml` to spin up frontend, backend, and MySQL in a local test network
  - Configured environment variables for service communication

- **Firebase Refactor:**
  - Replaced Firebase Admin SDK integration with a mock/stub to allow builds without secret keys
  - Adjusted `firebase.ts` and `authMiddleware.ts` to work without crashing

- **Successful Local Deployment:**
  - Verified local build using `docker-compose up --build`
  - App is accessible via:
    - Frontend: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
    - Backend API: [http://localhost:3000/products](http://localhost:3000/products)

## üöÄ Deployment Completed with CI/CD Pipeline

- ‚úÖ **Kubernetes manifests** created for deploying backend, frontend, and MySQL to a local `k3d` cluster  
- ‚úÖ **CI/CD Pipeline** implemented using GitHub Actions:
  - Split jobs for test, build, push, and deploy per service (frontend/backend)
  - Each push triggers automatic Docker image build, push to DockerHub, and `kubectl apply` to deploy
- ‚úÖ **Test Phases:** Included placeholders for backend and frontend tests ("No tests implemented yet")
- ‚úÖ **Secrets Management:** DockerHub credentials and kubeconfig securely stored in GitHub Actions Secrets
- ‚úÖ **Result:** Fully automated end-to-end deployment workflow from GitHub to Kubernetes
