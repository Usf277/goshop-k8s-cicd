# üöÄ GoShop: Dockerized & Deployable E-commerce Platform

> üõí Forked and customized from [ke444a/ecommerce-goshop](https://github.com/ke444a/ecommerce-goshop) ‚Äî full credit to the original author. This project is licensed under the MIT license.

GoShop is a full-stack e-commerce web application originally built with:
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript (Vite), Redux Toolkit, TailwindCSS, Firebase Auth, React Router, React Query
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Prisma ORM, Stripe, MySQL, Cloudinary

The application supports:
- Full product browsing, cart, and checkout
- Admin management of products and orders
- Firebase authentication with Google login
- Stripe payments
- PWA support and Cypress testing

## üõ†Ô∏è What I‚Äôve Done in This Fork

This fork transforms GoShop into a **DevOps-ready, containerized application** suitable for local development, testing, and deployment with Kubernetes.

### ‚úÖ Modifications & Additions:

- **Dockerization:**
  - Created a production-ready Dockerfile for the frontend (React + Vite + Nginx)
  - Used the original backend‚Äôs multistage Dockerfile for Node.js/Prisma

- **Docker Compose Setup:**
  - Added `docker-compose.yml` to spin up frontend, backend, and MySQL in a local test network
  - Configured environment variables for service communication

- **Firebase Refactor:**
  - Replaced Firebase Admin SDK integration with a mock/stub to allow builds without secret keys
  - Adjusted `firebase.ts` and `authMiddleware.ts` to work without crashing

- **Successful Local Deployment:**
  - Verified local build using `docker-compose up --build`
  - App is accessible via:
    - Frontend: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
    - Backend API: [http://localhost:3000/products](http://localhost:3000/products)

### üîß Next Step:
Prepare Kubernetes manifests and CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to deploy the app in a scalable environment.
